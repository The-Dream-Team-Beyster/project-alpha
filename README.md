# Geographical Boogie :notes::world_map:
**Geographical Boogie** is a fun and interactive learning game designed for **Key Stage 2 children (ages 7–11)**.
It helps students learn where all **44 European countries** are on a map through play, practice, and competition.

## Why Geographical Boogie?
Learning geography from textbooks can sometimes feel repetitive and hard to remember. Geographical Boogie turns memorisation into a **game**:
- Students **see, think, and act** by clicking on a map.
- Immediate **feedback** (right or wrong) helps them learn quickly.
- The **leaderboard** encourages friendly competition and motivation.
- It’s a short, focused game — perfect for classrooms or at-home learning.
